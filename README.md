## README

This assignment was to create generative text on an ESP32 TTGO Display.

The code included in this repository loops through a list of all of Burton Guster's
nicknames on the TV Show Psych as for display on an ESP32 TTGO microchip uploaded through the Arduino IDE.

The final project was displayed hanging from the ceiling in a library along with other ESP32s. A close up is shown below.

The code fits on a 135x240mm display, although some of the names are too long to fit in their entirety and get cut off.
To display exactly as shown above, the microchip was attached to a battery and taped into a paper box which was then suspended
from the cieling on a piece of thread attached to a popsicle stick slotted into a track in the ceiling.
